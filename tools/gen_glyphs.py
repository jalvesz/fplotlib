"""Regenerate src/fplotlib_glyphs_data.f90 from DejaVu Sans.

The vector backends hand the string to the format and let the viewer find
the font. PNG has no such luxury: it has to turn text into filled outlines
itself, so the outlines have to be in the library.

DejaVu Sans is matplotlib's default face, so using it is what makes fplotlib's
PNG text land in the same place as matplotlib's. Regular, bold and oblique
are emitted, and they are the real faces rather than a regular one smeared
or sheared, which is what matplotlib draws too.

What is stored is the font's own representation: quadratic outlines in
integer font units. Every point is a delta from the one before it, coded as
a magnitude class through a fixed prefix code plus the raw bits under the
leading one, which is deflate's trick for distances. Whole outlines repeat
between faces -- DejaVu builds the Greek capitals out of the Latin ones --
so identical ones are stored once and the slots point at them. The slots
themselves are written for the code points the table has something for
rather than for the gaps too, an outline number is usually just "the next
one", and an advance width is a delta from the same character in the face
it is a slanted copy of. The bit stream is then written into the Fortran
source as one base85 string, and fplotlib_glyphs unpacks it on first use and
elevates the quadratics to the cubics the rendering API speaks.
