"""Sphinx-Gallery support for Fortran examples that draw with fplotlib.

Sphinx-Gallery splits and highlights non-Python examples out of the box -- its
``BlockParser`` already recognises Fortran comments, so a ``.f90`` file whose
header is a ``!`` comment block becomes a gallery page with a title, prose and
syntax-highlighted code.  What it does not do is *run* them: every code block is
handed to :func:`compile`, because upstream only ever executes Python.

A Fortran example is not a script anyway.  It is a single compilation unit that
has to be built and run as a whole, so this extension replaces Sphinx-Gallery's
per-block executor for Fortran sources with one that

1. generates a throw-away fpm project whose only dependency is fplotlib itself
   and whose examples are the gallery sources,
2. builds it once per documentation build,
3. runs each example in a private working directory, and
4. hands the pictures it wrote to :func:`fplotlib_scraper`, which moves them
   into Sphinx-Gallery's image directory and emits the ``image-sg`` directives.

Pictures are attributed to the code block that saved them: the scraper reads the
``savefig`` and ``save_animation`` calls out of the block's own source, so a
figure appears under the code that produced it, exactly as it does for
matplotlib examples.  Any picture the example wrote without a literal filename
-- a name assembled at run time, say -- is attached to the last code block,
along with everything the program printed.

Because any format fplotlib writes is just a file on disk, SVG and animated GIF
need no special handling: Sphinx-Gallery already embeds and thumbnails both.

Usage in ``conf.py``::

    extensions = [..., "sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery", "fplotlib_gallery"]

    sphinx_gallery_conf = {
        "examples_dirs": "gallery",
        "gallery_dirs": "auto_gallery",
        "image_scrapers": ("fplotlib_gallery.fplotlib_scraper",),
        "reset_modules": (),
    }

``example_extensions`` and ``filetype_parsers`` are filled in automatically for
the Fortran suffixes; everything else is ordinary Sphinx-Gallery configuration.

Writing an example
------------------

Drop a Fortran program into the gallery directory, named to match
``filename_pattern`` (``plot_*.f90`` by default).  Its first lines are a ``!``
comment block holding the page's reST: a title, its underline, and as much
prose as it deserves.  Sphinx-Gallery's parser ends a text block at the first
blank line, so keep the header contiguous and write ``!`` on its own for the
blank lines inside it.

Later prose starts with ``! %%`` and continues on ``!`` lines, which also splits
the code either side of it into separate blocks::

    ! %%
    ! Now the interesting part.

    call plot(x, y, "b-")
    call savefig("picture.svg")

Nothing else is required: ``savefig("name.svg")`` puts that picture under this
block, and any format fplotlib writes will do.

Two things to know when building animations.  Frames have to come out the same
size, so keep anything that changes the layout out of the frame loop, and
``save_animation`` only writes GIF.

Finally, the example runs in an empty scratch directory of its own, so it may
write whatever it likes and should refer to its own files by plain relative
names.  ``sphinx-build -D plot_gallery=0`` renders the pages without a Fortran
toolchain: the examples are still parsed and highlighted, just not run.

A note on the timings
---------------------

The seconds Sphinx-Gallery prints for an example -- on its page and in
``sg_execution_times`` -- are the time the *program* took, plus the scraping of
its pictures.  Compiling is not included.  One fpm call builds the library and
every example together, so there is no honest way to split that cost per
example: charging it to whichever example ran first would make that one look
slow and would swing by a factor of five with the state of fpm's cache.  The
build is timed as a whole and logged instead, as ``[fplotlib] fpm finished in
...``.
