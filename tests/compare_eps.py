"""Compare fplotlib's EPS files to matplotlib's by rasterizing both.

Same argument as tests/compare_pdfs.py: PostScript is a program, not a
picture, so two files that draw the same page share almost nothing textually.
Both sides go through Ghostscript and the images are compared.

Two differences from the PDF comparison are expected and are properties of
the format, not defects. Text is a different typeface, because matplotlib
embeds a DejaVu Sans subset and fplotlib names the base-13 Helvetica; and
PostScript has no transparency, so fplotlib composites every alpha against the
page colour while matplotlib simply drops it. The limit below is set to
allow both and still catch a page that is actually drawn wrongly.
