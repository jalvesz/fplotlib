"""Compare fplotliblib's PDFs to matplotlib's by rasterizing both.

A PDF cannot be compared as bytes and is not worth comparing as structure:
two files can describe the same page with completely different operators. So
both sides are handed to the same rasterizer and the resulting images are
compared, which asks the only question that matters, whether the page looks
the same.

Text is the expected difference and it is a real one, not an artifact of the
measurement. Matplotlib embeds a subset of DejaVu Sans and draws text with
the same outlines it uses everywhere else. fplotliblib's PDF backend refers to the
base-14 Helvetica instead, so the file needs no embedded font at all, but the
glyphs are a different typeface and are spaced by Helvetica's widths while
the surrounding layout was computed from DejaVu's. Everything that is not
text should agree closely, and the per-case limit is set to catch it when it
does not.
