"""Compare fplotliblib's PNGs to matplotlib's, pixel by pixel.

The SVG comparison next door checks structure, because two renderers can
draw the same SVG differently and a bit comparison would be meaningless. For
PNG there is no such excuse: fplotliblib rasterizes the figure itself, so it can be
held to the actual pixels matplotlib produces.

The figures are not expected to be identical. fplotliblib lays out independently, so
a tick can land a fraction of a point away from matplotlib's, and after pixel
snapping a fraction of a point becomes a whole pixel. Text is the other source
of difference: matplotlib hints glyphs through FreeType and fplotliblib fills the
outlines unhinted, so stems land on slightly different pixels. What this test
is for is catching the errors that are not sub-pixel: a missing element, a
wrong colour, a shape drawn in the wrong place.
