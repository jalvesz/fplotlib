! fplotlib_proj3d — the 3D camera: the matrix mplot3d builds and applies.
!
! Everything here is matplotlib's mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/proj3d.py, in the same
! order and with the same constants, because the point of a 3D plot in this
! library is to look like the 3D plot matplotlib would have drawn. The four
! steps are: scale the data box to the unit cube (stretched by the plot-box
! aspect), look at its centre from a point on a sphere around it, rotate the
! world so the camera is at the origin, and divide by depth.
!
! The module is pure arithmetic, with no idea what an axes or a series is,
! which is why it sits outside fplotlib.f90 rather than inside it.
