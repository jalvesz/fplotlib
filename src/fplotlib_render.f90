! fplotlib_render — the backend rendering API.
!
! One abstract renderer that SVG, PNG, PDF and EPS each implement. The plotting
! code above it never learns which one it is talking to, so a new output format
! is a new module here and nothing else.
!
! Four rules keep the API from leaking any one format's habits:
!
!   1. No state machine. Every drawing call carries the paint it should be
!      drawn with, so nothing depends on what was called before it. A backend
!      may cache the last paint internally to avoid re-emitting attributes,
!      but that is its own business and cannot be observed through the API.
!
!   2. Purely additive, in painter's order. Calls are composited in the order
!      they arrive; later drawings cover earlier ones. A raster backend can
!      therefore rasterize each call immediately and never has to keep a
!      display list. Only the container has to wait: PNG deflates, PDF writes
!      its xref and SVG closes its root element in close_canvas.
!
!   3. One coordinate system, fixed here rather than negotiated. Points
!      (1/72 inch), origin at the top left, x right, y down, angles in degrees
!      clockwise. PDF and EPS flip this internally; PNG scales by its own dpi.
!      Callers never ask which way is up.
!
!   4. Geometry is reduced to what all four can express: straight lines and
!      cubic Beziers. There is no arc primitive, because only SVG has one;
!      the front end flattens its pie wedges into cubics that every backend
!      can already draw.
!
! What counts as a primitive
! --------------------------
! A call earns a place in the backend contract only when a backend has a real
! decision to make about it. Those are all deferred, so the compiler tells a
! backend author exactly what has to be written:
!
!   draw_path     the universal fallback shape
!   draw_rect     SVG <rect>, PDF "re", EPS rectfill, PNG an exact axis
!                 aligned span fill that needs no scanline work at all
!   draw_circle   SVG <circle>, EPS "arc", PNG an exact antialiased disc;
!                 PDF alone has to approximate with four cubics
!   draw_markers  one shape stamped at many points: SVG <defs> plus <use>,
!                 PDF a form XObject, EPS a defined procedure, PNG a cached
!                 sprite. Matplotlib emits 3330 <use> elements across our
!                 reference figures, so this is where scatter plots are won
!   draw_text     see the note on text below
!   draw_image    a raster block, for imshow
!
! Anything a backend would only ever implement one way is not a primitive, and
! it is not in this file at all. Lines, polylines and polygons are just paths,
! so the front end builds the path and calls draw_path; there is nothing for a
! backend to decide and so nothing to declare. Matplotlib goes further still
! and has draw_path as its only geometry primitive; its SVG backend emits no
! <rect> or <circle> at all, trading file size for a smaller contract.
!
! By the same rule this module is interface and nothing else. Text metrics,
! arc flattening and circle-to-cubic conversion are all absent: either a
! backend has a real reason to do them its own way, in which case that is the
! backend's own code, or it does not, in which case it belongs to whoever
! calls the API rather than to the API.
!
! begin_group and end_group are different again: they are concrete and default
! to doing nothing, because doing nothing is the correct implementation for a
! format without a document tree, not a lazy one. See the note on groups.

    ! Structure.
    !
    ! Why a group is worth an API call at all: it carries meaning the backend
    ! cannot reconstruct. Matplotlib nests every figure as figure_1 > axes_1 >
    ! line2d_1, and that tree is what lets someone open the figure in Inkscape
    ! or Illustrator and select "the second curve" as one object to restyle.
    ! For a paper figure that workflow matters more than anything else in the
    ! file. The same names give CSS and Javascript something to target.
    !
    ! Note what is deliberately not a reason. Hoisting a shared clip onto one
    ! <g clip-path=...> rather than repeating it on fifty children is an
    ! optimization the SVG backend can find by itself, by noticing a run of
    ! identical clips in the paint. Optimizations a backend can discover on
    ! its own do not belong in the contract.
    !
    ! PDF can map these onto marked content, which Illustrator reads as
    ! layers. EPS and PNG have no document tree, so ignoring them is correct.
